            <h3>1. Duckiebot Driving in a Straight Line</h3>
            <iframe src="image/videoplayback.webm" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>This video demonstrates the Duckiebot driving in a straight line. We encountered some drift during this demo, likely caused by uneven motor speeds or calibration issues, and in some cases, misshaped or uneven wheels.</p>

            <h3>2. Lane Following Demo</h3>
            <iframe src="image/Exercise%201%20-%20lane%20follow.mp4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>The lane-following demo starts with the Duckiebot attempting to follow a lane. At the first corner, it had trouble turning and staying on track, possibly due to network delays caused by many people using the same network. The bot made a large deviation to get back on track, which further suggests that there were delays between the computer and robot connections. However, as the demo progressed, the Duckiebot was able to follow the lane more accurately.</p>

            <h3>4. Intrinsics Calibration File</h3>
            <img src="image/instrinstic.png" alt="Screenshot of intrinsics calibration.yaml">
            <p>The intrinsics calibration file is crucial for ensuring the Duckiebot’s camera captures accurate images. Calibration helps with lens distortion and ensures that the camera’s field of view is correct.</p>

            <img src="image/extrinstic.png" alt="Screenshot of extrinsics calibration.yaml">
            <p>This screenshot of the extrinsics calibration file shows the relationship between the Duckiebot’s camera and the robot’s coordinate system. Proper extrinsics calibration helps in the accurate mapping of the camera’s field of view to the robot’s physical movement.</p>

        <h2>Reflection and Comments</h2>
        <p>
            This exercise involved setting up and calibrating the Duckiebot, as well as running demos to showcase its capabilities. Below are the key points:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We faced challenges because of the newer version of Ubuntu, which required us to set up a virtual environment to download all the dependencies. This was essential for ensuring compatibility and avoiding installation issues.</li>
            <li>Drift during straight-line driving was partly due to uneven motor speeds, calibration issues, and even misshaped or uneven wheels, which were sometimes not perfectly round.</li>
            <li>In the lane-following demo, at the first corner, the Duckiebot struggled with turning and stayed at the center of the line. We theorized that this was caused by delays from the network, which was congested by too many people using the same connection. Additionally, the bot made a significant deviation to get back on track, indicating a delay between the computer and the robot's control systems. As the demo continued, the Duckiebot performed better and followed the lane more accurately.</li>
            <li>Another challenge occurred when we were packing up, and our robot wouldn’t turn off. Despite trying several suggested solutions, we couldn’t resolve the issue. Adam, the instructor, even struggled to fix it and eventually had to unplug the robot manually for safety once we left.</li>
            <li>The Duckiebot likely uses a combination of computer vision and control algorithms to follow the lane, balancing input from the camera and motor commands.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Key takeaways: Robots are not always perfect. Calibrating them is one thing, but external factors, such as uneven mats caused by accidental steps, can affect their performance. Calibration can also go wrong—our calibration box had tape peeling off on one side, which distorted the image and made it less flat. Robots are a lot of work, and I learned that instead of always blaming the code for issues, it's important to also consider hardware problems that could affect the robot's performance.
